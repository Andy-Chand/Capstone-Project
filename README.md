***LEGACY CODE***
No longer maintained and server connections removed for security reasons. Website can be accessed to see a form of the application running and for demonstration purposes only.

A Google API based map used to showcase skills in C#, HTML, Javascript, SQL, and the Google Maps API itself. Made originally to be shown offline, it was moved to an online capacity to share with others.

This website should only be used to demonstrate the skills used to code the website and how it can be extrapolated to be used in other forms, not necessarily as a correlation implies causation scenario. Sample of skills involved: Google maps features, website development, SQL database management, etc.
